# JS Weather App

A Vanilla JavaScript Weatther web application built using Dark Sky API.

# What I Learned
 
* Learn how to fetch data from an API
* Learn how to get the location from the user and provide it to the API
* Implemented a proxy so the api works anywhere, even on a local server
* Implemented an addEventListener to change the temperature from Celsius to Farenhait when clicked on the temperature

# Want I'm working on improving

* Show one-day, three-days and seven-days weather information
* Change between the different options using a button
* Work on the CSS/aspect part of the web
